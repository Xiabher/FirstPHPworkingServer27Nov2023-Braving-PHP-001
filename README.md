today, i braved me self to checkout another intimidating languge PHP! sigh. 
what the hell is php? some kind of acid; some obscure chemical the oger at big farma fart?! 
anyway, i found out. 
it is another jacked up jsvascriptish htmlish webish languge; 
however, it is the backend cocos who came up with it -Preprocessor Hypertext ...politicaÂ¿! 
i don't know but something mouthful and high horse nerd, at least it is not acidic. 
so i chated the GPT out of it and started this repo loler. 

now me diarying dis Å¡it for meself.
